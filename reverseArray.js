// var array1 = ["yes", "no", "maybe", "always", "sometimes", "never", "if"];

// For example, array1.length would give us 7 
// because there are seven elements in it. 
// The index of each, however, is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. 
// So in order to begin at the element with an index of 6 weâ€™d need to take the length of the array and subtract 1.
